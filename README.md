# EDA-and-Classification-Iris-Titanic
Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Models on Iris and Titanic datasets using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.
This project demonstrates **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data cleaning**, 
**feature engineering**, and **classification model tuning** on two popular datasets: 
**Iris** and **Titanic**.

## Project Overview
- **Iris Dataset:** Used for basic classification practice, visualization, and model evaluation.
- **Titanic Dataset:** Real-world dataset with missing data, categorical encoding, and class imbalance challenges.

## Key Insights
- Women and first-class passengers had the highest survival rates.
- Fare and Pclass were among the strongest predictors of survival.
- Balancing data improved recall for survivors and made the model fairer.

## Results
- **Random Forest Classifier** achieved ~81â€“83% accuracy.
- **Balanced dataset** improved fairness without significantly hurting performance.
